While Openshift provides a lot of prebaked components, one can install thru the catalog – it’s NOT setting you up for rapid, well integrated and goverened software development. It’s an endless open toolkit.


That is why we have started github/opendevstack, with the goal that developers can focus on features and not on getting CI/CD to work.

This session introduces the why and shows how opendevstack works – from provisioniong to run in less than 3 minutes, based on Jenkins, sonarqube and other usefull CI components.
